[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static blog-aware site generator. That means you can blog by simply writing [Markdown](http://MrLoh.se/tags/ruby/) files on your computer without the need for a database while still using blog features like tags, categories, archives and so on. If you are a web-developer who prefers to write his own HTML over using a CMS, than Jekyll is for you. Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on the blastingly fast [GitHub Pages](http://MrLoh.se/tags/github-pages/) service. Jekyll is written in [Ruby](http://MrLoh.se/tags/ruby/) and has quite some [Plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/).
