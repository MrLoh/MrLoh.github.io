Lance Ulanoff on Mashable pretty much expressed my thoughts on the WWDC 2015 Apple Keynote yesterday:

> There was a lot of detail, but when I took some time to consider all that I had seen and learned, I realized that it was hard to pick out the really major stuff. [...]
> Am I disappointed? Mostly, no. I want better working, more efficient platforms. I see the potential in Apple Watch; I want Apple and its third-party app partners to tap into it. I want transit directions in Apple Maps, which we'll soon have.
> This was the story of the keynote. Lot of products and territory covered, lots of feature and performance updates across the board â€” but no breakout hit. [Lance Ulanoff on Mashable](http://mashable.com/2015/06/08/wwdc-2015-a-keynote-in-a-minor-key/)

Everything was expected. I'm a little disappointed with watchOS2, which brings only overdue features and more useless watch faces without complications --- why can't I get my activity rings together with jellyfish or photos. Swift2 and Transit directions will most likely bring the most change to my life and $15 for a family Apple Music subscription is cheaper than the competition, so maybe it'll have a chance.
