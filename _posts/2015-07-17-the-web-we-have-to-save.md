Hossein Derakhshan, an Iranian blogger who was just released from prison after 6 years, wrote a brilliant peace about the state of the web. His unique perspective in comparing the web from 6 years ago to the one today is very insightful. The web is not a decentralized space anymore where people freely interchange opinions and the hyperlink is the main connection, but it is dictated by SEO and Social Media algorithms that lead to masses of click bait articles and premature reviews which don't contain the content they promise. Hossein writes:

> The web was not envisioned as a form of television when it was invented. But, like it or not, it is rapidly resembling TV: linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking. [Hossein Derakhshan](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426)

This is a must read!
