description: The beginning of my new blog about code and more
---

This is my new blog. I'll write here about ideas, work, and experiences. Some of it might be reviews of technology and camera equipment, some of it might be philosophical, some might be about communication and productivity, and most of it will probably be about coding.

The idea is to capture accomplishments that might be useful to someone else, but mainly to just structure and document things for myself. I had the idea to create a new more general blog for a long time --- I previously had a blog about my [time in Kenya](http://www.tobiaslohse.com/kenya/blog/) and there is the [blog of Kijani](http://blog.kijani.co), an NGO I cofounded. What really triggered me into doing it was more time at hand after finishing my classes for my second bachelor in Computer Science and Philosophy and an article by [John O'Nolan](http://john.onolan.org/), the founder of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), on [WebdesignerDepot](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/04/how-to-grow-a-successful-design-career-by-blogging/).

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) --- the static blog generator --- and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. It should be really fast and still have a lot of nice features. The theme is completely hand coded with love and CSS3. The source-code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/MrLoh/MrLoh.github.io), get inspired if you feel like it. I based the color scheme on this amazing photo from [Emmanuel Coupé](http://www.emmanuelcoupe.com/photo/is0779/), that I found on this amazing tumblr [natural pallets](http://palettes.co/post/75914098457/photo-by-emmanuel-coupe).

I'm gonna write more about some of the features of this blog and how they are set up. Some of the highlights include:

- Inline comments powered by [carnival](https://carnivalapp.io/)
- [Kudos](http://amitu.com/2013/04/kudos-using-parse-for-jekyll/) that let you show your appreciation anonymously
- Full year, month and tag archives (read more about the set up [here](http://MrLoh.se/2015/06/automatic-archives-for-jekyll-on-github-pages/))
- Beautiful styles for
  - Codeblocks
  - Blockquotes
  - Images with captions
  - Headings with [balanced text](https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/balance-text)
  - CSS3 animations on links and more

## I hope you will enjoy reading more here soon.
